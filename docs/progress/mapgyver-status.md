# MapGyver implementation status

**Updated: 2026-11-03 · Overall: `███░░░░░░░` 27% · 3/11 phases complete**

**Verified gates: `██████░░░░` 60% · 34/57 accepted** (phase completion above remains 3/11).

**Current topic:** M04/4 accepted: complete Spout input lifecycle and isolation on both GPUs.
**Next deliverable:** M04/5 actual generic manager/Channels/Inspector typed-field and folder acceptance.
**Execution:** M04/1–4,7–8 and M05/4,6–7,9–10 accepted; M04/5 alone is Active on `mapgyver`.
M04/6 and retained physical/timing gates stay in the explicit return queue.
**Remaining requirement:** audit complete actual source-manager/Channels/generic Inspector
interaction and closed-folder capabilities, then revised caller/Picture/project/resource parity.
**Newly usable:** exact Spout selection, absence/restart/rename/resize and RGBA alpha are verified
on Intel and RTX, with a healthy input staying live through peer failure. Cross-adapter sources
fail explicitly without moving the renderer's GPU; local selection recovers. Native metadata,
fixed-output sizing, shared subscriptions and declared overlap/storage admission all pass.
**Usable now:** native Source crop/mapping/calibration, held Inspector feedback and selection/history;
immutable background reads keep loaded controls usable; functional native zoom alignment is accepted;
responsive Screen target/resolution/per-output FPS and Surface source-media tree
supplements; actual submitted FPS, selected GPU, CPU submit time and tracked renderer allocations
in the shared workbench footer, with coarse observations and automatic stream recovery;
backend Fill Screen and centered Fit to Screen preserve cropped-source aspect
and other Surface settings, with one-step Undo and native automatic Picture sizing;
Alt-drag from Surface bodies or corners translates the entire quad as one
Undo gesture, including at zoom; 1/Shift-10-output-pixel corner movement with held-repeat/chord grouping into
one Undo gesture, independent of editor zoom; actual Screen Surface/Inspector and background
selection, selected/hover handles, independent per-editor corner selection and undoable pointer
dragging; shared smooth anchored
zoom in Screen, Surface Source and Composition;
simultaneous independent Media Preview panels with follow/lock, channel choice,
paged grid, actual reconnect/project recovery and independent output lifetime;
typed source/variant/Reference authoring, generic Inspector and paged Channels,
actual Composition child media/Placement and Matrix Cell media, default Reference and independent
Alt-copy drops, automatic/pinned outputs, unavailable-target recovery and owned-media retirement.
**Last delivered capability:** [complete Spout source lifecycle](mapgyver-m04-spout.md).
M04/4 closes with full both-adapter lifecycle/metadata/pixels, RGBA straight alpha and native
declared-capacity/retirement evidence. Prior native output/editor gates remain accepted.
No timing/physical requirement is waived.
Whole-app Q04 and broader source/render/display qualification retain their existing gates.

**Counting:** overall = fully accepted phases / 11, rounded to the nearest percent.
Phase/subphase progress = verified gates / that scope's fixed gates; bars round to tenths.
There are **34/57 accepted gates**; denominators are unchanged. M04/4 now passes full Spout
source acceptance on both hardware adapters plus declared-input capacity. Prior native output/
editor and API/history/read-fencing evidence remain valid; physical/latency matrix stays open.
The additional gate-progress bar uses accepted gates / 57, rounded; it does not replace or
inflate the unchanged phase-completion calculation above.
Partial work, planning and unavailable checks earn no gate.

**Scope revision:** the prior plan was 5/10 phases (50%), with 40/48 gates accepted.
The updated requirements reopen affected M04–M08 acceptance and add M10. M04 changes 6/6→1/8
(reopen 1,2,4,5,6; add Reference/Preview); M05 5/8→3/10 (reopen 6,7; add bounds/supplements);
M06 4/4→0/5 (reopen 1–4; add independent panels); M07 3/4→0/4 (reopen 1,2,4);
M08 3/4→1/4 (reopen 2,3); M10 adds 0/4. Other gates are unchanged.
This adds nine gates, reopens sixteen and changes the phase denominator from 10 to 11.
Earlier evidence is retained for reuse, with its original schema/build limits; no new feature
or gate was accepted by merging the plan.

## Execution board and return queue

Exactly one gate is selected Active. Pending rows are the return queue, not concurrent work.

| State    | Gate(s)          | Missing requirement / concrete next or return action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Active   | M04/5            | Audit actual manager/Channels/generic Inspector interactions against the revised typed source/variant model, selection/history/project lifetime and folder capabilities. Reuse accepted creation/Channels/Resolution/API browser evidence; port retained legacy source UI coverage without dropping original checks. Start the next bounded batch after this milestone is pushed. |
| Accepted | M04/4            | [Complete Spout source acceptance](mapgyver-m04-spout.md): exact discovery/selection, full lifecycle and healthy-peer isolation, fixed-output resize metadata/pixels, both adapter mismatch directions/recovery, RGBA/alpha, declared overlap/storage limits and retirement pass. |
| Accepted | M05/4            | [Concurrent output independence](evidence/mapgyver-concurrent-output-2026-11-03.json): fullscreen/rectangle live native pixels and stable independent Spout frames through actual editor close, OS-confirmed minimize/restore and project-New retirement. |
| Accepted | M05/9            | [Stable output HWND](evidence/mapgyver-output-bounds-2026-11-03.json): position-only session preservation, resize/Undo, fullscreen across both current displays, return to rectangle and completion-safe disable pass with one native window creation and exact bounds/red pixels. |
| Accepted | M05/6–7          | [Native paint and accepted-frame input](evidence/mapgyver-native-zoom-sync-2026-11-03.json): Screen and internal-landmark Source motion, output-specific moving native hits, offset browser event routing and complete native selection/keyboard/translation/Fill/Fit/Source lifecycle suites pass. Physical latency is not inferred. |
| Accepted | M05/10           | [Complete outliner/footer contract](evidence/mapgyver-workbench-status-2026-11-03.json): bounded responsive target/resolution/source rows, actual individual output FPS and public shared footer with native values and recovery. |
| Accepted | M04/8            | [Complete original contract verified](evidence/mapgyver-media-preview-native-2026-11-03.json): eight simultaneous native views, independent persisted panel choices, actual reconnect/New/Load, completion-based close/lock retirement and stable independent Screen/Spout output with exact pixel oracles. |
| Accepted | M04/7            | [Original functional contract audited and passed](evidence/mapgyver-reference-native-2026-11-03.json): typed/API/bundled parity, cycles/identity/history/project, six complete native source/hardware cases and the bounded 10k backend fixture. Whole-app Q04 remains M09 with M06/M07 dependencies. |
| Accepted | M04/1–2          | [Source authoring/API](mapgyver-m04-source-api.md) and [native variants/Resolution/sharing](mapgyver-m04-variants.md), including both hardware adapters and stable identity through history/reload.                                                                                                                       |
| Pending  | M04/6            | After M04/5, finish full revised UI/script/headless parity, missing/relinked/replaced Picture behavior, duplication/history/project and functional native resource recreation. M04/3 Picture worker bounds retain acceptance. |
| Pending  | M06/1–5          | After M04 ownership/Reference and M05 viewport contracts, replace instances with child media, use degrees/new anchors and verify independent follow/lock panels. Replace the existing global Composition `InspectManager` refresh with bounded owner/catalog reads; Reference's paged query alone does not qualify whole-app scale. |
| Pending  | M08/2–4; M07/1–4 | After M06, establish reusable app-control configuration/runtime keys, then revised Matrix ownership/grid/trigger semantics and aggregate demand. Verify actual picker and retained retirement/access cases; remove Applications workflow.                                                                                 |
| Pending  | M10/1–4          | After revised M04–M08 contracts, implement common-codec transport, HAP, DXV/WebP and bundled recovery/performance in that order.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Blocked  | M03/4            | Missing genuine device-removal/recovery acceptance. Return after a recorded safe reset/removal route is authorized and software prerequisites pass; preserved injected-recreation evidence alone is insufficient.                                                                                                         |
| Pending  | M03/9            | Original GPU critical-path/window timing and reproduced private-growth failure need corrective qualification, not additional user/tool permission. Return in its bounded qualification lane with an ownership correction and supported timing evidence; no unchanged benchmark reruns or budget revision. |
| Blocked  | M05/5,8          | Full physical hotplug, 150/200% and negative-origin/latency coverage is unverified. Native pixels and the known local displays now permit automatic cases; run the retained exact physical matrix, preserving missing configurations and measurement requirements. |
| Waiting  | M09/1            | All revised feature and retained qualification gates; then complete Q01–Q06, actual-app statistics and Windows artifact checks.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Evidence and handoff

- [Historical acceptance and batch evidence](mapgyver-evidence-through-2026-11-02.md) preserves
  the complete previous ledger, including the unfinished Matrix Parameter batch and rejected
  timing/memory proposals. Its old execution boards are non-operative.
- [Qualification contract](mapgyver-qualification-contract.md) owns retained budgets, revised
  Composition/Reference and Video workloads, and separately accounted software decode uploads.
- Native user observations: [Screen/Surface](evidence/mapgyver-m05-manual-editor-acceptance-2026-11-02.json),
  [Composition](evidence/mapgyver-m06-manual-editor-acceptance-2026-11-02.json),
  [Matrix playback](evidence/mapgyver-m07-manual-playback-acceptance-2026-11-02.json).
  Brief “preview unavailable” on restore was accepted for now; other timing/alignment budgets remain.
- Prior Matrix Parameter and icon/presentation work is preserved, unaccepted, in named stash
  `mapgyver-pre-revision-matrix-parameters-and-icons-2026-11-02`, object
  `f550ec0c03e907e9ebab44891538f1030358c30a`. Do not restore it automatically; reconcile its
  typed-row work when revised M07 becomes active and its presentation work separately.
- **Current handoff:** M04/4 Spout source acceptance, start 12:21 CET / cutoff 13:06 CET;
  accepted before cutoff. Existing lifecycle fixture now includes explicit RGBA storage/alpha
  through its owned production-runtime source. Source/harness compile and strict Clippy exit 0;
  Golden qualification software suite 188 pass/24 hardware ignores. App runtime code is unchanged
  from retained 340-pass software success. Full lifecycle passes both GPUs in 88.18 seconds,
  first native run this batch, including corrected fixed-output resize metadata, cross-adapter
  failure/recovery and RGBA alpha 128/127 within the unchanged 2/255 tolerance. Golden declared
  overlap/storage/retirement native case passes in 1.93 seconds with healthy frames preserved.
  Owned producers exit successfully; none remain. [Evidence](evidence/mapgyver-spout-acceptance-2026-11-03.json)
  supersedes the partial 2026-11-02 return action. Next is M04/5 complete actual generic source UI
  acceptance, then M04/6 parity/Picture/project/resource behavior. No limit or budget changed.
  Prior M05/4 is pushed in `08a33d84`; unrelated user files/icons remain untouched.
  Counts remain M05 4/10 (40%), 29/57 gates (51%), 3/11 phases (27%).
  Host capacity recovery is configured under `%USERPROFILE%/.codex/tools/goal-recovery`, with
  23/23 tests and real read-only RPC verified. Activation still needs one VS Code Reload Window;
  the current IDE connection is not protected and live recovery is unverified. No product gate awarded.

## Maintenance rule

Replace current state and the single current-batch/handoff entry in place. Keep this page
focused on progress, missing acceptance and next action. Link necessary detailed results in
owning reports/evidence; do not append daily logs, transcripts or duplicate dashboards.
At each implementation batch start, replace the handoff entry with deliverable, owner, proving
check and stopping time; at its end record only the current result and exact remaining scope.
