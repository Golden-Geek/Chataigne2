# MapGyver implementation status

**Updated: 2026-11-04 · Overall: `█████░░░░░` 50% · 6/12 phases complete**

**Verified gates: `███████░░░` 73% · 49/67 accepted** (phase completion above remains 6/12).

**Current topic:** M11/3 automatic high-performance GPU selection and explicit adapter identity.
**Next deliverable:** M11/3 discrete GPU by default with persisted typed explicit adapter choice and truthful recovery.
**Execution:** M08/1–3, M04/1–8, M05/4,6–7,9–10, M06/1–5, M07/1–4 and M11/1–2 are Accepted; M11/3 alone is Active on `mapgyver`.
Retained physical/timing gates stay in the explicit return queue.
**Priority update:** [M11 feedback corrections](../plan/MapGyver_Implementation_Plan.md#m11--resolve-the-2026-11-03-feedback-before-video-and-final-qualification)
adds ten gates, **all ahead of M10 and M09**. Current functional order: M11 → M10 → M09;
M08/4's retained qualification must still pass before M10/M09. The recorded ordering change
uses AGENTS.md's functional-delivery rule and the plan's rule 6; no requirement is waived.
Earlier acceptance covers its tested contract; changed behavior must pass M11. Planning accepts no gate.
**Remaining requirement:** complete app-control transient retirement, M11 feedback, Video and retained
physical/performance/final qualification. Retained requirements and timing/retirement budgets
remain intact; M11/2 explicitly revises the fixed allocation-capacity policy.
**Newly usable:** [Automatic high-performance GPU selection](mapgyver-m11-gpu.md).
Two actual desktop cold starts select NVIDIA despite Intel being raw adapter zero/display owner.
Three 4K previews and eight-view/output continuity pass on the exact reported NVIDIA identity.
The shared-texture receiver retains that adapter through renderer/project changes. M11/3 remains
open for a typed persisted choice, restart reporting and missing-device/recovery acceptance.
**Usable now:** typed media/References and independent previews; Screen/Surface mapping and
native outputs; child-media Composition/editors; Matrix model/playback/grid and typed owned
app control. The phase reports below own their detailed acceptance and remaining qualification.
**Last delivered capability:** Golden resolves OS high-performance/exact explicit adapter identities;
MapGyver pins automatic selection through renderer recreation and reports the actual device.
399 app/191 Golden tests, strict lint, generated/UI checks and actual native continuity pass.
No new gate closes this slice; M11/2's earlier capacity/retirement acceptance remains intact.
M08 remains 3/4 and Blocked on its separate retirement barrier.
Retained physical/timing requirements remain open; M11 owns changed feedback scope.

**Counting:** overall = fully accepted phases / 12, rounded to the nearest percent.
Phase/subphase progress = verified gates / that scope's fixed gates; bars round to tenths.
There are **49/67 accepted gates**. Native ownership correction and complete adapter checks accept M11/2.
M08 stays 3/4. M07 remains
complete at 4/4 and fully accepted phases remain 6/12. Denominators are unchanged.
The 2026-11-03 feedback added M11 with ten fixed gates, changing the gate denominator 57 → 67
and phase denominator 11 → 12. Planning itself added no acceptance. M11 owns changed-contract
verification; prior evidence is reusable only where its tested behavior remains applicable.
The additional bar uses accepted gates / 67.
Partial work, planning and unavailable checks earn no gate.

**2026-11-02 scope revision:** the prior plan was 5/10 phases (50%), with 40/48 gates accepted.
The updated requirements reopen affected M04–M08 acceptance and add M10. M04 changes 6/6→1/8
(reopen 1,2,4,5,6; add Reference/Preview); M05 5/8→3/10 (reopen 6,7; add bounds/supplements);
M06 4/4→0/5 (reopen 1–4; add independent panels); M07 3/4→0/4 (reopen 1,2,4);
M08 3/4→1/4 (reopen 2,3); M10 adds 0/4. Other gates are unchanged.
This adds nine gates, reopens sixteen and changes the phase denominator from 10 to 11.
Earlier evidence is retained for reuse, with its original schema/build limits; no new feature
or gate was accepted by merging the plan.

Return in its bounded qualification lane with an ownership correction and supported timing evidence; no unchanged benchmark reruns or budget revision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Blocked  | M05/5,8  | Full physical hotplug, 150/200% and negative-origin/latency coverage is unverified. Native pixels and the known local displays now permit automatic cases; run the retained exact physical matrix, preserving missing configurations and measurement requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Waiting  | M09/1    | All revised feature, **M11 feedback** and retained qualification gates; then complete Q01–Q06, actual-app statistics and Windows artifact checks. Reconcile the older cross-editor source-drop fixture's channel-row/reference-only assumptions with current ownership and M11 before final regression qualification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Evidence and handoff

- [Historical acceptance and batch evidence](mapgyver-evidence-through-2026-11-02.md) preserves
  the complete previous ledger, including the unfinished Matrix Parameter batch and rejected
  timing/memory proposals. Its old execution boards are non-operative.
- [Qualification contract](mapgyver-qualification-contract.md) owns retained budgets, revised
  Composition/Reference and Video workloads, and separately accounted software decode uploads.
- Native user observations: [Screen/Surface](evidence/mapgyver-m05-manual-editor-acceptance-2026-11-02.json),
  [Composition](evidence/mapgyver-m06-manual-editor-acceptance-2026-11-02.json),
  [Matrix playback](evidence/mapgyver-m07-manual-playback-acceptance-2026-11-02.json).
  Brief “preview unavailable” on restore was previously accepted for that scope; M11/1 now requires
  explicit flash/transition acceptance. Other timing/alignment budgets remain.
- Prior Matrix Parameter and icon/presentation work is preserved, unaccepted, in named stash
  `mapgyver-pre-revision-matrix-parameters-and-icons-2026-11-02`, object
  `f550ec0c03e907e9ebab44891538f1030358c30a`. Do not restore it automatically. Its typed-row
  approach is reconciled in the current conversion; its older model/host/presentation
  changes remain un-restored and unaccepted.
- **Current batch/handoff:** M11/3 automatic GPU selection slice, started 07:49 CET /
  stopping time 08:34 CET (2026-11-04). Earlier source inspection was interrupted after its
  02:54–03:39 window; no product changes or accepted gates resulted during that interruption.
  Delivered reusable Golden high-performance selection, pinned renderer identity and actual-device
  reporting. Owner: Golden Video and MapGyver desktop host. 399 app/191 Golden tests, four UI tests,
  strict all-target lint, generated contract, Svelte zero errors/warnings and both formatters pass.
  Two fresh native cold starts choose NVIDIA; three 4K previews and eight-view reconnect/close/
  New/Load pass, with eight complete output pixel checks and 770 independent receives without
  absent/failed/mismatched frames. [Evidence and exact remaining scope](mapgyver-m11-gpu.md).
  **No gate closed this slice.** Next product deliverable: typed persisted application preference,
  explicit choices on both GPUs, restart reporting and missing-device/recovery acceptance. Never
  substitute an explicit missing device. Recovery supervisor is active and its
  23 deterministic tests/read-only integration pass; actual service-outage recovery is unobserved.
  Previous batch closed M11/2 in pushed/verified `dca00e1d` (remote equal, 0/0). M11/3 alone is
  Active; M08/4 retains its recorded blocker/return trigger. Totals: 49/67 gates (73%), 6/12 phases
  (50%), M11 2/10 (20%). Preserve concurrent label/theme work and the named stash.

## Maintenance rule

Replace current state and the single current-batch/handoff entry in place. Keep this page
focused on progress, missing acceptance and next action. Link necessary detailed results in
owning reports/evidence; do not append daily logs, transcripts or duplicate dashboards.
At each implementation batch start, replace the handoff entry with deliverable, owner, proving
check and stopping time; at its end record only the current result and exact remaining scope.
