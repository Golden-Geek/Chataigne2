# MapGyver implementation status

**Updated: 2026-11-03 · Overall: `███░░░░░░░` 27% · 3/11 phases complete**

**Current topic:** M04 Reference media.
**Next deliverable:** Composition/Matrix child-media containment and default Reference/Alt-copy
drop semantics required by M04/7; retain full mixed Matrix, scale and native parity acceptance.
**Execution:** M04/1–2 accepted; M04/7 continues on `mapgyver`, with one active gate. Source
qualification M04/4–6 remains in the return queue under the plan's recorded functional order.
**Blocker for next delivery:** none known. Retained native/timing/memory/display blockers are below.
**Usable now:** shared typed media Resolution/Sampling and bounded Channels editing through
the generic Inspector, media-owned procedural canvases and Matrix settings, sender-only Shared
Texture authoring, typed source commands and named scripting from the Inspector, source media,
Screen/Surface editing, Composition and Matrix playback, and paged Reference output inspection.
**Last delivered capability:** the [Reference Channels section](../architecture/mapgyver-reference-media.md)
shows live target labels/order in bounded pages, distinguishes missing/unconfigured targets and
opens the real target channel's generic Inspector for editing. Membership changes and target
recovery require no copied channel nodes. Named scripts and typed commands share the query.
Full Reference acceptance remains open.
**Last accepted:** [M04/2 native source variants](mapgyver-m04-variants.md): all three source
kinds on Intel Graphics and NVIDIA RTX 5080, including shared Resolution, three consumers,
source resize, reorder/history/reload and pixels. Broader native qualification remains open.

**Counting:** overall = fully accepted phases / 11, rounded to the nearest percent.
Phase/subphase progress = verified gates / that scope's fixed gates; bars round to tenths.
There are **26/57 accepted gates**. Partial work, planning and unavailable checks earn no gate.

**Scope revision:** the prior plan was 5/10 phases (50%), with 40/48 gates accepted.
The updated requirements reopen affected M04–M08 acceptance and add M10. M04 changes 6/6→1/8
(reopen 1,2,4,5,6; add Reference/Preview); M05 5/8→3/10 (reopen 6,7; add bounds/supplements);
M06 4/4→0/5 (reopen 1–4; add independent panels); M07 3/4→0/4 (reopen 1,2,4);
M08 3/4→1/4 (reopen 2,3); M10 adds 0/4. Other gates are unchanged.
This adds nine gates, reopens sixteen and changes the phase denominator from 10 to 11.
Earlier evidence is retained for reuse, with its original schema/build limits; no new feature
or gate was accepted by merging the plan.

## Execution board and return queue

Exactly one gate is selected Active. Pending rows are the return queue, not concurrent work.

| State    | Gate(s)          | Missing requirement / concrete next or return action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Active   | M04/7            | Typed targets, virtual channels, shared render plans, API/history and paged Inspector presentation/navigation verified. Next implement actual Composition/Matrix child-media containment and default Reference/Alt-copy drops. Full mixed Matrix parity, end-to-end scale and native sharing/resampling/recovery remain open. |
| Accepted | M04/1–2          | [Source authoring/API](mapgyver-m04-source-api.md) and [native variants/Resolution/sharing](mapgyver-m04-variants.md), including both hardware adapters and stable identity through history/reload.                                                                                                                       |
| Pending  | M04/4–6          | Return after Reference's authored-model/rendering/API/UI product deliveries at the next allocated qualification batch. Finish full Spout lifecycle/cross-adapter/RGBA/declared-capacity cases, audit generic UI/lifetime and broad revised caller/Picture/resource parity. M04/3 Picture worker bounds retain acceptance. |
| Pending  | M04/8            | After Reference working contracts, deliver independent dockable Media Preview instances with selection-follow/lock/channel/grid state and retirement; remove Inspector previews and complete native/bundled acceptance.                                                                                                   |
| Pending  | M05/6,7,9,10     | After working revised media, deliver shared smooth navigation, Screen handles/keyboard/Fill/Fit, stable visible output-bounds updates and outliner supplements.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Pending  | M06/1–5          | After M04 ownership/Reference and M05 viewport contracts, replace instances with child media, use degrees/new anchors and verify independent follow/lock panels. Replace the existing global Composition `InspectManager` refresh with bounded owner/catalog reads; Reference's paged query alone does not qualify whole-app scale. |
| Pending  | M08/2–4; M07/1–4 | After M06, establish reusable app-control configuration/runtime keys, then revised Matrix ownership/grid/trigger semantics and aggregate demand. Verify actual picker and retained retirement/access cases; remove Applications workflow.                                                                                 |
| Pending  | M10/1–4          | After revised M04–M08 contracts, implement common-codec transport, HAP, DXV/WebP and bundled recovery/performance in that order.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Blocked  | M03/4            | Missing genuine device-removal/recovery acceptance. Return after a recorded safe reset/removal route is authorized and software prerequisites pass; preserved injected-recreation evidence alone is insufficient.                                                                                                         |
| Blocked  | M03/9            | Original GPU critical-path proof/window timing remain unresolved; private-growth criterion failed. Return with supported bounded-error timing evidence or an explicit scope decision, and a concrete ownership correction for the preserved memory failure. No unchanged benchmark reruns or implicit budget revision.    |
| Blocked  | M05/4,5,8        | Missing physical concurrent-output/hotplug/DPI/presentation coverage. Return with reported display resolution/scaling/layout/available outputs and actual native access; run the exact retained matrix.                                                                                                                   |
| Waiting  | M09/1            | All revised feature and retained qualification gates; then complete Q01–Q06, actual-app statistics and Windows artifact checks.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Evidence and handoff

- [Historical acceptance and batch evidence](mapgyver-evidence-through-2026-11-02.md) preserves
  the complete previous ledger, including the unfinished Matrix Parameter batch and rejected
  timing/memory proposals. Its old execution boards are non-operative.
- [Qualification contract](mapgyver-qualification-contract.md) owns retained budgets, revised
  Composition/Reference and Video workloads, and separately accounted software decode uploads.
- Native user observations: [Screen/Surface](evidence/mapgyver-m05-manual-editor-acceptance-2026-11-02.json),
  [Composition](evidence/mapgyver-m06-manual-editor-acceptance-2026-11-02.json),
  [Matrix playback](evidence/mapgyver-m07-manual-playback-acceptance-2026-11-02.json).
  Brief “preview unavailable” on restore was accepted for now; other timing/alignment budgets remain.
- Prior Matrix Parameter and icon/presentation work is preserved, unaccepted, in named stash
  `mapgyver-pre-revision-matrix-parameters-and-icons-2026-11-02`, object
  `f550ec0c03e907e9ebab44891538f1030358c30a`. Do not restore it automatically; reconcile its
  typed-row work when revised M07 becomes active and its presentation work separately.
- **Current milestone:** M04/7 mirrored-output presentation, owned by MapGyver's media read
  model and Inspector. Start 2026-11-03 00:29 CET; cutoff 01:14 CET; finished within the box.
  `InspectChannels` returns at most 128 snapshots; the Inspector mounts 32 rows/page with live
  labels/order, missing/unconfigured states and real target-channel editing through shared
  selection. A one-active/one-latest reader fences obsolete session/project/history replies.
  Named `inspectChannels`, committed callbacks, a typed command and embedded snippets share
  the query. Generated TypeScript stays Rust-owned; command schema remains v2 (31 kinds).
  **Checks:** full library suite 295 passed/one ignored, including generated drift, all command
  kinds, named callback parity and a 512-channel/128-Reference detached-tree fixture. Queries
  retain only their page, do not materialize mirrored nodes and preserve history/project state.
  Three UI reader tests cover coalescing, stale replies, project/history/disconnect/edit changes
  and disposal. Svelte check: zero errors/warnings; strict all-target native-feature Clippy,
  ordinary bundled build, formatting and diff checks passed. Bundled Reference/catalog check
  passed: real Target/Resolution/history, live rename/reorder/membership, target-channel Color
  editing, second-page removal/clamping and missing-target Undo recovery. Existing Channels,
  Shared Texture, script and command browser workflows also passed; ordinary-source Save/New/
  Load passed. Whole-app scale is not established: existing Composition global catalog reads
  are explicitly retained in M06's return action. No native experiment was run.
  **Gate change:** none; M04/7 remains Active. Next deliver actual child-media containment and
  default Reference/Alt-copy drops in Composition/Matrix as M04/7 integration prerequisites;
  later M06/M07 gates still require their complete revised behavior. Full mixed Matrix parity,
  end-to-end scale and native sharing/resampling/recovery remain required. Counts remain
  26/57 gates, M04 38%, 3/11 phases (27%).

## Maintenance rule

Replace current state and the single current-batch/handoff entry in place. Keep this page
focused on progress, missing acceptance and next action. Link necessary detailed results in
owning reports/evidence; do not append daily logs, transcripts or duplicate dashboards.
At each implementation batch start, replace the handoff entry with deliverable, owner, proving
check and stopping time; at its end record only the current result and exact remaining scope.
