# MapGyver implementation status

**Updated: 2026-11-04 · Overall: `█████░░░░░` 50% · 6/12 phases complete**

**Verified gates: `████████░░` 75% · 50/67 accepted** (phase completion above remains 6/12).

**Current topic:** M11/4 expanded Color rows and fixed Linear sampling verified; Picture File remains.
**Next deliverable:** single typed File per Picture channel with one authoritative asset locator, then final complete Inspector/caller/layout acceptance.
**Execution:** M08/1–3, M04/1–8, M05/4,6–7,9–10, M06/1–5, M07/1–4 and M11/1–3 are Accepted; M11/4 alone is Active on `mapgyver`.
Retained physical/timing gates stay in the explicit return queue.
**Priority update:** [M11 feedback corrections](../plan/MapGyver_Implementation_Plan.md#m11--resolve-the-2026-11-03-feedback-before-video-and-final-qualification)
adds ten gates, **all ahead of M10 and M09**. Current functional order: M11 → M10 → M09;
M08/4's retained qualification must still pass before M10/M09. The recorded ordering change
uses AGENTS.md's functional-delivery rule and the plan's rule 6; no requirement is waived.
Earlier acceptance covers its tested contract; changed behavior must pass M11. Planning accepts no gate.
**Remaining requirement:** complete app-control transient retirement, M11 feedback, Video and retained
physical/performance/final qualification. Retained requirements and timing/retirement budgets
remain intact; M11/2 explicitly revises the fixed allocation-capacity policy.
**Newly usable:** [Expanded typed channel controls](mapgyver-m11-inspector.md#expanded-typed-channel-controls).
Color edits need no nested Parameters folder; kind/sampling controls are gone and sampling is
fixed to Linear. Native editing/CRUD/history/paging and both-GPU Fit/Composition pixels pass.
Fit Mode, unit-preserving clocks and typed GPU Preferences remain delivered.
M11/4 stays open for the single Picture File control and final complete Inspector acceptance.
**Usable now:** typed media/References and independent previews; Screen/Surface mapping and
native outputs; child-media Composition/editors; Matrix model/playback/grid and typed owned
app control. The phase reports below own their detailed acceptance and remaining qualification.
**Last delivered capability:** direct typed Color editing, fixed Linear sampling and rename-event
correction; 407 app tests, six integration tests, strict lint, UI checks, 78 native images and
native/headless browser editing/history/paging pass.
This slice closes no gate; verified progress remains 50/67. Retained physical/device-removal/timing
qualification remains required.
M08 remains 3/4 and Blocked on its separate retirement barrier.
Retained physical/timing requirements remain open; M11 owns changed feedback scope.

**Counting:** overall = fully accepted phases / 12, rounded to the nearest percent.
Phase/subphase progress = verified gates / that scope's fixed gates; bars round to tenths.
There are **50/67 accepted gates**. Complete typed Preferences and native adapter checks accept M11/3.
M08 stays 3/4. M07 remains
complete at 4/4 and fully accepted phases remain 6/12. Denominators are unchanged.
The 2026-11-03 feedback added M11 with ten fixed gates, changing the gate denominator 57 → 67
and phase denominator 11 → 12. Planning itself added no acceptance. M11 owns changed-contract
verification; prior evidence is reusable only where its tested behavior remains applicable.
The additional bar uses accepted gates / 67.
Partial work, planning and unavailable checks earn no gate.

**2026-11-02 scope revision:** the prior plan was 5/10 phases (50%), with 40/48 gates accepted.
The updated requirements reopen affected M04–M08 acceptance and add M10. M04 changes 6/6→1/8
(reopen 1,2,4,5,6; add Reference/Preview); M05 5/8→3/10 (reopen 6,7; add bounds/supplements);
M06 4/4→0/5 (reopen 1–4; add independent panels); M07 3/4→0/4 (reopen 1,2,4);
M08 3/4→1/4 (reopen 2,3); M10 adds 0/4. Other gates are unchanged.
This adds nine gates, reopens sixteen and changes the phase denominator from 10 to 11.
Earlier evidence is retained for reuse, with its original schema/build limits; no new feature
or gate was accepted by merging the plan.

Return in its bounded qualification lane with an ownership correction and supported timing evidence; no unchanged benchmark reruns or budget revision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Blocked  | M05/5,8  | Full physical hotplug, 150/200% and negative-origin/latency coverage is unverified. Native pixels and the known local displays now permit automatic cases; run the retained exact physical matrix, preserving missing configurations and measurement requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Waiting  | M09/1    | All revised feature, **M11 feedback** and retained qualification gates; then complete Q01–Q06, actual-app statistics and Windows artifact checks. Reconcile the older cross-editor source-drop fixture's channel-row/reference-only assumptions with current ownership and M11 before final regression qualification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Evidence and handoff

- [Historical acceptance and batch evidence](mapgyver-evidence-through-2026-11-02.md) preserves
  the complete previous ledger, including the unfinished Matrix Parameter batch and rejected
  timing/memory proposals. Its old execution boards are non-operative.
- [Qualification contract](mapgyver-qualification-contract.md) owns retained budgets, revised
  Composition/Reference and Video workloads, and separately accounted software decode uploads.
- Native user observations: [Screen/Surface](evidence/mapgyver-m05-manual-editor-acceptance-2026-11-02.json),
  [Composition](evidence/mapgyver-m06-manual-editor-acceptance-2026-11-02.json),
  [Matrix playback](evidence/mapgyver-m07-manual-playback-acceptance-2026-11-02.json).
  Brief “preview unavailable” on restore was previously accepted for that scope; M11/1 now requires
  explicit flash/transition acceptance. Other timing/alignment budgets remain.
- Prior Matrix Parameter and icon/presentation work is preserved, unaccepted, in named stash
  `mapgyver-pre-revision-matrix-parameters-and-icons-2026-11-02`, object
  `f550ec0c03e907e9ebab44891538f1030358c30a`. Do not restore it automatically. Its typed-row
  approach is reconciled in the current conversion; its older model/host/presentation
  changes remain un-restored and unaccepted.
- **Current batch/handoff:** M11/4 compact channel editing, started 10:04 CET / stopping time
  10:49 CET (2026-11-04), delivered before cutoff. Media v7/Reference v3/command v5 remove authored
  sampling throughout schemas/DTOs/automation; render preparation uses Linear. Golden public
  inline/density hooks expose real channel Parameters; Enter rename no longer collapses its row.
  407 app and six integration tests, generated contracts, strict lint, 236 Golden/17 controller UI
  tests and Svelte 0/0 pass. Native Color/CRUD/history/37-channel paging passes; sibling stability
  passes 12 actions/1,020 frames. Both GPUs pass 24 Fit and 54 Linear Composition images. Complete
  headless source/history/Save/New/Load and updated Resolution/Layer-clock/channel/sender browser
  checks pass. [Receipt and exact limits](mapgyver-m11-inspector.md#expanded-typed-channel-controls).
  Next exact requirement: one typed Picture File retaining single-authority catalog assets, sharing,
  import/relink/reload; final full generic-Parameters browser entry/caller/layout audit remains.
  No new gate closes; M11/4 alone stays Active. No blocker. Totals remain 50/67 (75%), 6/12 phases
  (50%), M11 3/10 (30%). Prior Fit milestone `f319e63e` is pushed/verified; this capability is the
  next milestone. Preserve concurrent user work and retained gates; push before the next batch.

## Maintenance rule

Replace current state and the single current-batch/handoff entry in place. Keep this page
focused on progress, missing acceptance and next action. Link necessary detailed results in
owning reports/evidence; do not append daily logs, transcripts or duplicate dashboards.
At each implementation batch start, replace the handoff entry with deliverable, owner, proving
check and stopping time; at its end record only the current result and exact remaining scope.
