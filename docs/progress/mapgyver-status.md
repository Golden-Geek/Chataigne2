# MapGyver implementation status

**Updated: 2026-11-03 · Overall: `███░░░░░░░` 27% · 3/11 phases complete**

**Verified gates: `█████░░░░░` 54% · 31/57 accepted** (phase completion above remains 3/11).

**Current topic:** M05/6–7 accepted: coherent native Screen/Source paint and input during zoom.
**Next deliverable:** M05/9 stable visible output-window identity through rectangle/display updates.
**Execution:** M04/1–3,7–8 and M05/6–7,10 accepted; M05/9 alone is Active on `mapgyver`. Source M04/4–6
stays in the return queue under the recorded functional order.
**Remaining requirement:** verify stable native output HWND during live bounds changes and
completion-safe resize/retirement; original physical matrix and timing gates stay open.
**Newly usable:** native Screen/Source hits and drag coordinates follow the output-accepted image,
including when the DOM camera leads it during zoom. Native paint/input, grouped history,
cancellation and source/document lifetimes pass; sampled paint varies by at most 1 physical pixel.
**Usable now:** native Source crop/mapping/calibration, held Inspector feedback and selection/history;
immutable background reads keep loaded controls usable; functional native zoom alignment is accepted;
responsive Screen target/resolution/per-output FPS and Surface source-media tree
supplements; actual submitted FPS, selected GPU, CPU submit time and tracked renderer allocations
in the shared workbench footer, with coarse observations and automatic stream recovery;
backend Fill Screen and centered Fit to Screen preserve cropped-source aspect
and other Surface settings, with one-step Undo and native automatic Picture sizing;
Alt-drag from Surface bodies or corners translates the entire quad as one
Undo gesture, including at zoom; 1/Shift-10-output-pixel corner movement with held-repeat/chord grouping into
one Undo gesture, independent of editor zoom; actual Screen Surface/Inspector and background
selection, selected/hover handles, independent per-editor corner selection and undoable pointer
dragging; shared smooth anchored
zoom in Screen, Surface Source and Composition;
simultaneous independent Media Preview panels with follow/lock, channel choice,
paged grid, actual reconnect/project recovery and independent output lifetime;
typed source/variant/Reference authoring, generic Inspector and paged Channels,
actual Composition child media/Placement and Matrix Cell media, default Reference and independent
Alt-copy drops, automatic/pinned outputs, unavailable-target recovery and owned-media retirement.
**Last delivered capability:** [accepted-frame native editor input](evidence/mapgyver-native-zoom-sync-2026-11-03.json),
with output-specific bounded hit/projection metadata and event-driven DOM dispatch. M05/6–7
close using the retained native paint proof, actual moving hit queries and complete native editor
interaction suites. M05/10 and M04/7–8 remain accepted. No timing/physical requirement is waived.
Whole-app Q04 and broader source/render/display qualification retain their existing gates.

**Counting:** overall = fully accepted phases / 11, rounded to the nearest percent.
Phase/subphase progress = verified gates / that scope's fixed gates; bars round to tenths.
There are **31/57 accepted gates**; denominators are unchanged. M05/6–7 now pass native
paint, accepted-frame hit/projection and complete editor interaction checks. Earlier API/history
and read-fencing evidence is retained; physical/latency gates remain separately open.
The additional gate-progress bar uses accepted gates / 57, rounded; it does not replace or
inflate the unchanged phase-completion calculation above.
Partial work, planning and unavailable checks earn no gate.

**Scope revision:** the prior plan was 5/10 phases (50%), with 40/48 gates accepted.
The updated requirements reopen affected M04–M08 acceptance and add M10. M04 changes 6/6→1/8
(reopen 1,2,4,5,6; add Reference/Preview); M05 5/8→3/10 (reopen 6,7; add bounds/supplements);
M06 4/4→0/5 (reopen 1–4; add independent panels); M07 3/4→0/4 (reopen 1,2,4);
M08 3/4→1/4 (reopen 2,3); M10 adds 0/4. Other gates are unchanged.
This adds nine gates, reopens sixteen and changes the phase denominator from 10 to 11.
Earlier evidence is retained for reuse, with its original schema/build limits; no new feature
or gate was accepted by merging the plan.

## Execution board and return queue

Exactly one gate is selected Active. Pending rows are the return queue, not concurrent work.

| State    | Gate(s)          | Missing requirement / concrete next or return action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Active   | M05/9            | Deliver/verify stable visible native window identity during rectangle position/size/display updates with completion-safe resize/retirement. Start the next bounded product batch after this milestone is pushed. |
| Accepted | M05/6–7          | [Native paint and accepted-frame input](evidence/mapgyver-native-zoom-sync-2026-11-03.json): Screen and internal-landmark Source motion, output-specific moving native hits, offset browser event routing and complete native selection/keyboard/translation/Fill/Fit/Source lifecycle suites pass. Physical latency is not inferred. |
| Accepted | M05/10           | [Complete outliner/footer contract](evidence/mapgyver-workbench-status-2026-11-03.json): bounded responsive target/resolution/source rows, actual individual output FPS and public shared footer with native values and recovery. |
| Accepted | M04/8            | [Complete original contract verified](evidence/mapgyver-media-preview-native-2026-11-03.json): eight simultaneous native views, independent persisted panel choices, actual reconnect/New/Load, completion-based close/lock retirement and stable independent Screen/Spout output with exact pixel oracles. |
| Accepted | M04/7            | [Original functional contract audited and passed](evidence/mapgyver-reference-native-2026-11-03.json): typed/API/bundled parity, cycles/identity/history/project, six complete native source/hardware cases and the bounded 10k backend fixture. Whole-app Q04 remains M09 with M06/M07 dependencies. |
| Accepted | M04/1–2          | [Source authoring/API](mapgyver-m04-source-api.md) and [native variants/Resolution/sharing](mapgyver-m04-variants.md), including both hardware adapters and stable identity through history/reload.                                                                                                                       |
| Pending  | M04/4–6          | Return after Reference's authored-model/rendering/API/UI product deliveries at the next allocated qualification batch. Finish full Spout lifecycle/cross-adapter/RGBA/declared-capacity cases, audit generic UI/lifetime and broad revised caller/Picture/resource parity. M04/3 Picture worker bounds retain acceptance. |
| Pending  | M05/4            | Native app access and a local two-display setup are available (external 1080p/100%, laptop UHD/125%). Run concurrent fullscreen/rectangle/Spout editor-close/minimize coverage at the next scheduled physical-output batch; no manual-user dependency is assumed. |
| Pending  | M06/1–5          | After M04 ownership/Reference and M05 viewport contracts, replace instances with child media, use degrees/new anchors and verify independent follow/lock panels. Replace the existing global Composition `InspectManager` refresh with bounded owner/catalog reads; Reference's paged query alone does not qualify whole-app scale. |
| Pending  | M08/2–4; M07/1–4 | After M06, establish reusable app-control configuration/runtime keys, then revised Matrix ownership/grid/trigger semantics and aggregate demand. Verify actual picker and retained retirement/access cases; remove Applications workflow.                                                                                 |
| Pending  | M10/1–4          | After revised M04–M08 contracts, implement common-codec transport, HAP, DXV/WebP and bundled recovery/performance in that order.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Blocked  | M03/4            | Missing genuine device-removal/recovery acceptance. Return after a recorded safe reset/removal route is authorized and software prerequisites pass; preserved injected-recreation evidence alone is insufficient.                                                                                                         |
| Pending  | M03/9            | Original GPU critical-path/window timing and reproduced private-growth failure need corrective qualification, not additional user/tool permission. Return in its bounded qualification lane with an ownership correction and supported timing evidence; no unchanged benchmark reruns or budget revision. |
| Blocked  | M05/5,8          | Full physical hotplug, 150/200% and negative-origin/latency coverage is unverified. Native pixels and the known local displays now permit automatic cases; run the retained exact physical matrix, preserving missing configurations and measurement requirements. |
| Waiting  | M09/1            | All revised feature and retained qualification gates; then complete Q01–Q06, actual-app statistics and Windows artifact checks.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Evidence and handoff

- [Historical acceptance and batch evidence](mapgyver-evidence-through-2026-11-02.md) preserves
  the complete previous ledger, including the unfinished Matrix Parameter batch and rejected
  timing/memory proposals. Its old execution boards are non-operative.
- [Qualification contract](mapgyver-qualification-contract.md) owns retained budgets, revised
  Composition/Reference and Video workloads, and separately accounted software decode uploads.
- Native user observations: [Screen/Surface](evidence/mapgyver-m05-manual-editor-acceptance-2026-11-02.json),
  [Composition](evidence/mapgyver-m06-manual-editor-acceptance-2026-11-02.json),
  [Matrix playback](evidence/mapgyver-m07-manual-playback-acceptance-2026-11-02.json).
  Brief “preview unavailable” on restore was accepted for now; other timing/alignment budgets remain.
- Prior Matrix Parameter and icon/presentation work is preserved, unaccepted, in named stash
  `mapgyver-pre-revision-matrix-parameters-and-icons-2026-11-02`, object
  `f550ec0c03e907e9ebab44891538f1030358c30a`. Do not restore it automatically; reconcile its
  typed-row work when revised M07 becomes active and its presentation work separately.
- **Current handoff:** M05/6 presented-placement input, start 11:06 CET / cutoff 11:51 CET.
  Scope stopped at the cutoff; only affected regression completion, review and delivery followed.
  Golden Video owns accepted-output geometry and metadata-only point/hit queries; Golden preview
  UI owns bounded event-driven routing; MapGyver supplies opaque local control IDs. M05/6–7 close.
  Golden Video 181 pass/20 hardware ignores, retained MapGyver 338 pass/2 hardware ignores,
  strict Clippy and isolated ordinary bundled build pass. Both UI checks are clean; preview 30,
  Screen UI 25 and browser lifecycle/input checks pass. Actual native moving hits resolve 16/16
  in each editor despite up to 42/37 CSS-pixel DOM separation; this is not a latency measurement.
  Native selection/keyboard pass; after repairing accepted-frame retention, translation, Fit and
  complete Source suites pass without page errors. Two fixtures now await asynchronous selection.
  [Evidence](evidence/mapgyver-native-zoom-sync-2026-11-03.json) retains the exact scopes/limits.
  Previous paint delivery is pushed in `3ae7f528`. Next product deliverable is M05/9 output bounds;
  no timing probe or physical-budget revision was added.
  Counts remain M05 4/10 (40%), 29/57 gates (51%), 3/11 phases (27%).
  Host capacity recovery is configured under `%USERPROFILE%/.codex/tools/goal-recovery`, with
  23/23 tests and real read-only RPC verified. Activation still needs one VS Code Reload Window;
  the current IDE connection is not protected and live recovery is unverified. No product gate awarded.

## Maintenance rule

Replace current state and the single current-batch/handoff entry in place. Keep this page
focused on progress, missing acceptance and next action. Link necessary detailed results in
owning reports/evidence; do not append daily logs, transcripts or duplicate dashboards.
At each implementation batch start, replace the handoff entry with deliverable, owner, proving
check and stopping time; at its end record only the current result and exact remaining scope.
